# recording-survives-sigkill — Pack B dynamic chaos test (compose mode).
#
# Scenario: create a bot, record for ~90 s, SIGKILL the bot mid-third-chunk,
# assert earlier chunks landed in MinIO and Recording.status=IN_PROGRESS.
#
# NOTE: this is the "dynamic proof" for incremental upload. Because the
# tests3 compose VM environment here uses a stub/fixture MediaRecorder
# output, the scenario runs in a smoke variant: verify the endpoint's
# chunk_seq semantics via direct curl (rather than via a real browser
# session). The rich end-to-end scenario is enumerated in scope.yaml's
# human_verify block and executed at the human stage.
#
# This static-leaning compose check proves:
#   (1) POST /internal/recordings/upload with chunk_seq=N, is_final=false
#       creates a new media_file entry + Recording.status=uploading
#   (2) POST with chunk_seq=N+1, is_final=true flips status to COMPLETED
#   (3) Between (1) and (2), the first chunk's object is retrievable
#       from MinIO — i.e. if the bot were SIGKILLed after step (1), the
#       chunk would still be durable.
