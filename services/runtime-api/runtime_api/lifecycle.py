"""Lifecycle management — idle timeouts and callback delivery.

Idle loop: periodically checks running containers and stops those that
have exceeded their profile's idle_timeout without a /touch heartbeat.

Callback delivery: POSTs {container_id, name, profile, status, exit_code, metadata}
to the callback_url provided at container creation time.
Retries with exponential backoff (default: 1s, 5s, 30s).

    Three responsibilities, one loop tick:
      (1) Stop containers that have been idle past their profile's timeout.
      (2) Re-try any exit callback that has not yet been acknowledged by the
          consumer. This makes exit-callback delivery durable across consumer
          outages — without it, runtime-api gives up after CALLBACK_RETRIES
          and the downstream meeting row is stuck 'active' forever.
      (3) v0.10.5 Pack K.2 — sweep browser_session:* secondary index for
          orphans whose container_name is missing from the primary
          `runtime:container:*` index. [PLATFORM] data on #273 showed 14
          stale browser_session entries vs 0 actual K8s pods — pods were
          reaped but the secondary index never reconciled, leading to the
          "Browser session not found or expired" UX symptom.

    v0.10.5 Pack K.5 — heartbeat instrumentation logs the loop's tick
    rate. Without an external observable, can't tell whether the loop is
