"""Tests for the Pack E.1.a v2 lock-before-snapshot fix.

Background
==========
[PLATFORM] code review on #272 (issuecomment-4327366063, 2026-04-27 13:42Z)
flagged that the v1 shape acquired SELECT … FOR UPDATE AFTER snapshotting
``meeting.data``, allowing a stale-read race:

  1. Request A loads ``meeting.data`` snapshot → media_files = []
  2. Request B loads ``meeting.data`` snapshot → media_files = []
  3. Request A acquires FOR UPDATE → appends [audio] → commits → releases
  4. Request B acquires FOR UPDATE → appends [video] (using its stale
     snapshot still showing []) → commits → AUDIO ENTRY LOST

The v2 fix (commit 686ce5f) moves SELECT FOR UPDATE BEFORE the snapshot
in the meeting_data branch. The snapshot is then re-derived under the
lock, so request B's snapshot includes A's commit.

Test surfaces
=============
This file ships THREE tests at increasing fidelity:

* ``test_lock_acquired_before_snapshot_in_source`` — ast-based static
  assertion on the source. Cheapest, catches the regression even in
  mock-only CI. Runs in <50 ms.

* ``test_sequential_audio_then_video_both_persist`` — sanity test that
  the v2 shape preserves prior-shape behavior: two sequential uploads
  for the same session_uid (audio + video) yield ``media_files == [audio, video]``.

* ``test_concurrent_audio_video_no_lost_entry`` — deterministic
  interleaving simulation using a stateful mock DB. Two coroutines
  upload audio + video concurrently via ``asyncio.gather``; the test
  verifies the final ``media_files`` contains both. With the v1 (broken)
  code this would fail; with the v2 fix it passes.

For real-Postgres concurrency proof, a separate integration test
(skipped here) would run against an actual asyncpg connection. The
[PLATFORM] production-side observer (``len(media_files) <
num_distinct_media_types_in_S3`` audit, see #272 issuecomment-4327676126)
covers that surface in production traffic.
